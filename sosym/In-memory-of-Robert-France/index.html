<p>The SoSyM team has been devastated to learn about the
passing of Prof. Robert B. France, on the evening of Sunday,
February 15th, 2015. His passing was painless, after a
battle against cancer. He was 54 years old.</p>

<div class="row" style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        
            <picture>

    </div>

<p>Robert was a co-founder of SoSyM and served as its
Editorin-Chief since its inception in 1999. He passionately
believed that the modeling community needed their own
journal to be able to read and publish innovations in the
areas of modeling, model languages, use of models, tooling,
etc. Throughout the past 16 years, Robert has been a major
driving force behind this journal. We dedicate this
editorial to his memory.</p>

<h5 id="roberts-scientific-life"><strong><em>Robert’s scientific life</em></strong></h5>

<p>Robert started his scientific life at the University of the
West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago in the
Caribbean. He graduated in 1984 and began working as a
computer specialist in a project called USAID Census in the
St. Vincent office of a US company. In 1986, he moved on to
the Massey University in Palmerston, New Zealand, where he
received his PhD in Computer Science in 1990. From
1990–1992, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the
University of Maryland, Institute for Advanced Computer
Studies, USA.</p>

<p>Robert was appointed as an assistant professor at the
Computer Science and Engineering Department, Florida
Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida and stayed there
for 6 years
(1992–1998). In 1999, he moved to the Colorado State
University (CSU) in Fort Collins as a tenured Associate
Professor and was promoted to a Full Professor in 2004.</p>

<p>In 2006–2007, Robert spent his sabbatical year at Lancaster
University in the UK and at IRISA/INRIA in Rennes, France.
He also made a number of extended scientific visits:
to the University of Nice in 2009 and 2012, to SINTEF,
Norway in 2009 and 2011, and the University of Pau in 2003.
From 2011, he held a position as a visiting Adjunct
Professor at the University of the West Indies. In his
visits and travels, he was often accompanied by his wife
Sheriffa.</p>

<p>Robert was active at CSU in both organizational and
scientific positions for as long as his health allowed him
and even helped to organize the Modularity conference which
took place in Fort Collins in March 2015.</p>

<p>During his scientific life, Robert made a remarkable number
of research contributions. His CV (last updated in August 2014) lists</p>

<ul>
  <li>33 journal articles</li>
  <li>10 book chapters</li>
  <li>1 invited paper</li>
  <li>107 refereed conference papers</li>
  <li>40 refereed workshop papers</li>
  <li>13 proceedings and journal editorials</li>
</ul>

<p>and we know that more papers with his name are still being
published. As of March 20, 2015, DBLP lists 236 published
entries co-authored by Robert, including informal summaries
and SoSyM editorials, and an astonishing list of 223
collaborating authors. Google Scholar lists 387 entries!
Since he was an Editor-in-Chief of SoSyM from its inception,
Robert was never allowed to publish his work there. So his
modeling papers were mostly published at conferences.
Otherwise, we are sure that his journal paper count would
have been even higher!</p>

<p>In addition to his amazing research productivity and a 16
year labor-intensive commitment to SoSyM, Robert was also an
active member of IEEE-CS, ACM, and the OMG. In addition, he
served on one of the UML task forces as part of his OMG
participation. Robert served as a keynote speaker, invited
panelist, panel moderator, invited speaker, summer school
lecturer, and, in addition, gave numerous talks at companies
and conferences all around the world. He also served as an
Associate Editor of IEEE Computer
(2006–2012) and the Journal of Software Testing,
Verification and Reliability (2006–2015). Furthermore, he
cared deeply about the Computer Science educational
curriculum, serving on the IEEE Computer Society Educational
Activities Board (2011–2013). However, his most sustainable
scientific service achievement was the role he played in
establishing the UML/MODELS conference series. He was the
General Chair and the Local Arrangements Chair of the first
UML/MODELS conference held in Fort Collins, right after
an initial UML workshop in France in 1998. This conference
series brought together a research community that eventually
made SoSyM the success it is today.</p>

<h5 id="scientific-achievements"><strong><em>Scientific achievements</em></strong></h5>

<p><em>A prolific, innovative, visionary researcher. Robert’s
website says:</em></p>

<p>My primary area of research is model-driven development (
MDD). MDD research aims to reduce the significant effort
currently associated with developing and analyzing large
software-intensive systems through the use of modeling
languages that provide powerful abstractions, and
technologies for manipulating models. Models are created for
a variety of purposes, for example, to support formal
analysis of functional, security or performance properties,
and to support automated generation of testing,
implementation, or deployment artifacts. My research group
at CSU focuses on:</p>

<ol>
  <li>compositional approaches to model-driven software
development,</li>
  <li>managing model evolution,</li>
  <li>rigorous analysis of software properties using models,</li>
  <li>use of models to support runtime adaptation of software
(models@runtime),</li>
  <li>model-based development of software-product lines, and</li>
  <li>domain-specific modeling languages and metamodeling.</li>
</ol>

<p>Robert was an outstanding researcher. Early in his career he
was mainly active in the formal methods area. He felt that
formal methods were important to deeply understand and
analyze systems and programs. At that time, Robert and
others realized that the complexity of systems we develop
can only be tamed with the extensive use of models. The next
generation of modeling languages that would fit the
objectoriented programming paradigm which was dominant at
that time, as it is today, was about to converge into the
Unified Modeling Language (UML). In 1997, the precise UML
group
(pUML) started discussions and had its first publications in
1998 [9,10,15]. After that, an increasing number of people
joined the pUML effort, inspired by the challenge of
creating a usable in practice yet precise modeling language.
The group met at least twice each year, at appropriate
conferences, including at UML/MODELS’99. Robert’s interests
at that time—bringing together formal methods and usable
modeling languages—put him in the front and centre of the
pUML effort.</p>

<p>Throughout his scientific life, he continued publishing
high-quality papers on analyzing models using precise, if
not formal techniques. Some prominent publications
include [28] on the analysis of UML behavioral
properties, [6,22,27] on various aspects of model-based
testing, [13] on the question of how to apply formal design
techniques in industry, and [14] as early work on the
integration of formalisms with informal modeling techniques.</p>

<p>His interests also included combining agility with
modeling [25,26], as well as the more general considerations
of methodological challenges to successfully using models in
software development [7,16,18].</p>

<p>Robert’s research in the last decade focused on the use of
aspects in modeling. In [21], Robert and his co-authors
discussed adaptivity based on aspects in a model-driven
setting and in [24], the development of service-oriented
systems with aspects. Ghosh et al. [20] discusses how to
apply aspects to describe distributed applications. France
et al. [19]
and Reddy et al. [23] discuss ways of integrating aspects
into design modeling and composing design models using
aspects.</p>

<p>A novel and exciting research direction grew out of the use
of aspects for variability modeling. In [4], Robert and his
co-authors discuss the possibility of using aspect-oriented
techniques for feature modeling. Acher et al. [2] extends
this approach to decomposition techniques on feature models,
and, finally, [3] and [5] concentrate on feature-based
development proposing a domain-specific language FAMILIAR
for managing large-scale feature models.</p>

<p>Robert was also interested in a variety of specific uses of
modeling. For example, in [1] he and his colleagues
discussed questions of security based on a generalized
role-based access control model that includes geographical
and temporal aspects.</p>

<p>In his most recent line of research, he was collaborating
with colleagues in the newly formed GEMOC initiative on the
globalization of modeling languages [8]. This initiative
includes both the loose and the tighter coupling of tools,
e.g., for editing or simulating models of several languages
as well as language composition. Robert was extremely
excited about the possibility to finally be able to
efficiently combine several heterogeneous modeling
languages, each describing individual aspects and views of
the overall system within a single project. A need for this
kind of globalization within a precisely defined set of
modeling languages, ideally with formal semantics, goes back
to Robert’s early research work, and, in fact, all the way
to his Ph.D. thesis.</p>

<p>The papers discussed above are only some of highlights of
the consistently innovative work that Robert has done over
his 20 years of academic activity, starting with his first
workshop paper at SERF’95.</p>

<p>A tireless and passionate community builder. Robert was
passionate about research community building. Beyond the
pUML initiative, setting up the UML (MODELS) conference
series, and the founding of the SoSyM Journal, he actively
promoted various initiatives aimed to facilitate increasing
the maturity of MDE and building a community around it. We
single out two of such initiatives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the ReMoDD initiative which aims to create a repository of
models on which to build sound and reproducible
experimental results; and</li>
  <li>the GEMOC initiative which aims to develop the
foundations, methods, and tools that facilitate the
creation, integration, and automated processing of
heterogeneous modeling languages.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>A talented and dedicated educator</em>. Robert was not only an
outstanding researcher but also a dedicated and talented
educator. Sharing his knowledge with students, mentoring
them, and seeing their success gave him true joy. He was an
inspiring speaker who, at the same time, was always
accessible to his students. In 2014, Colorado State
University named him Professor Laureate, the highest honor
that can be awarded to a professor, in recognition of his
teaching talent and his dedication to his students.</p>

<p>Outside of his university, he actively participated in
modernizing and improving the Computer Science Curriculum,
by serving as a member of the <em>IEEE/ACM Computer Science
Curriculum Recommendation</em>, <em>CS2013</em> and as a head of the
committee on <em>IEEE Curricula</em>. He ran the international
program REUSSI—an exchange program for US students in INRIA,
France—and mentored many researchers around the world,
helping them understand the challenges and rewards of being
a researcher, and develop scientific rigor as well as
effective communication and collaboration skills.</p>

<h5 id="our-personal-relationships"><strong><em>Our personal relationships</em></strong></h5>

<p>Robert has 351 friends at LinkedIn; most of them active
members of the modeling community. At LinkedIn, he was also
a member of two groups: UML&amp;FM and Jazz group— his favorite
leisure activity. This high co-author count is a testament
to Robert’s approach to research—he was always interested in
discovering, discussing, and understanding new scientific
questions. He was brimming with enthusiasm and ideas. He was
also a perfect collaborator: extremely reliable, hard
working, full of ideas, and at the same time extremely
friendly, open, and welcoming. All of us collaborated with
Robert at various times in his life, on scientific or
organizational projects, and all enjoyed this collaboration
immensely.</p>

<p>All members of the SoSyM team knew Robert for many years and
all consider him to be their personal friend. Yet among us,
it was Bernhard who had the longest working relationship and
friendship with Robert. We have asked him to highlight a few
episodes of this relationship. Bernhard: “I first met Robert
at a workshop on Applying Formal Methods to Object-based
Distributed Systems, in 1997. With similar background and
interests, we immediately found ourselves involved in
passionate discussions about a variety of research topics.
These discussions led to joint publications on UML (the
Unified Modeling Language), on issues of formalizing
modeling languages, metamodeling, etc. [9–12,15]. Robert
became one of the principle researchers in the newly formed
pUML (precise UML)
group.</p>

<p>My discussions with Robert led us to collaborate in a number
of research service activities. In 1998, after the first UML
workshop, I was asked to organize a follow-up, but I agreed
to do this only together with Robert. He recognized the
important role such a conference could play in giving a
voice to the budding modeling community and graciously
agreed. So, in 1999, the two of us ran the first UML
conference in Fort Collins, Colorado, with Robert as General
and Local Arrangements Chair, and myself as Program Chair.
Putting together the local organization and the financing,
and dealing with all the bureaucracy was a major endeavor,
which Robert handled with his usual humor and grace. He was
a perfect organizer!</p>

<p>Based on the success of the ’99 conference, Robert, Jean
Bezivin, Piere-Alain Muller, and myself formed the
UML/MODELS Steering Committee, which Robert chaired, to
ensure that the conference continues to run annually. The
important role that this conference series has played in the
scientific community is due to the large extent to Robert’s
leadership on this steering committee and the tone he set at
UML’99.</p>

<p>Together with Robert, we also started the Journal on
Software and Systems Modeling (SoSyM) with a special issue
based on that first UML’99 conference. Since that time,
Robert acted as Editor-in-Chief of SoSyM, working closely
with all the editors, authors, and reviewers to build up the
journal’s reputation, set its vision, and keep the journal a
success. For Robert, SoSyM was really the labor of love. He
put his heart and soul into it, helping turn it into the
premier publication venue it is today.</p>

<p>Throughout all these years, through all the events and
activities, I was truly blessed with having Robert as my
colleague, my collaborator, and my close personal friend. We
often crossed the Atlantic to work with each other. Through
a number of long-term visits to Fort Collins, I got to tour
Colorado with Robert and his wife Sheriffa (including a very
cold and very windy trip to the top of the Rockies in 2013),
shared terrific dinners and wine tastings with them, and had
passionate research conversations with Robert that went deep
into the night. We celebrated Robert’s last birthday
together with all participants of a Dagstuhl seminar on
Globalizing DomainSpecific Languages, many of them being
close friends of Robert’s, in a small German winery in
October 2014. Even at that seminar, as always, Robert was
full of passion, enthusiasm, and ideas.”</p>

<h5 id="robert-and-sosym"><strong><em>Robert and SoSyM</em></strong></h5>

<p>The International Journal on Software and Systems Modeling (
SoSyM) published its first issue in the Summer 2002. A large
number of people and organizations had to come together to
get the journal off the ground. The list includes Springer (
initially Mr. Engesser and now Mr. Gerstner who act as an
interface to many other staff members helping us out behind
the scenes), scientific advisers such as Jean Bezivin and
Pierre-Alain Muller and all the editors and those brave
first authors who sent in their good papers, helping make
SoSyM a success. However, SoSyM’s success is due, to the
greatest extent, to the vision, perseverance, good taste,
and endless energy that Robert has put into his job as one
of its two Editors-in-Chief. At that time, it was necessary
to market the journal at various conferences, to precisely
define the guidelines for a rigorous yet fair reviewing
process, etc. Robert did that with persistence, creativity,
and grace.</p>

<p>SoSyM became a success and in a second phase, it needed to
continue to run smoothly as the number of submissions
steadily increased. Robert and Bernhard divided their
responsibilities, with Robert managing the regular papers
and Bernhard the special issues and expert voices. That was
the time when Geri Georg and Martin Schindler started
helping out with the journal as well. They concentrated on
the workflow of papers, allowing Robert to concentrate his
energy on the initial reading and judgment of papers, their
distribution to Associate Editors, managing critical cases,
and also stepping in when various problems arose. Like any
other journal, SoSyM was not immune to having authors
complain about their papers being unfairly rejected, double
submissions (which, to our knowledge, all have been detected
before publication!) and plagiarism. Robert handled many of
such cases—always politely but firmly and fairly.</p>

<p>As the number of submissions and published manuscripts
continued to increase, two years ago we have restructured
the process of handling papers yet again, introducing three
Associate Editors-in-Chief—Martin Gogolla, Marsha Chechik,
and Jean-Marc Jezequel. Their role is to do the initial
judgment of new manuscripts, before they are sent out for a
detailed review, as well as to manage the assignment of
Associate Editors to papers. This restructuring enabled
Robert to take a more strategic role in the development of
SoSyM. SoSyM would simply not exist in its current shape
without Robert and without the tremendous job he has done on
it in the past 16 years. For example, this issue breaks
another record in the number of pages in it. All these
terrific papers that we are so excited to publish!</p>

<p>Robert was born on October 8th, 1960 in Jamaica and was
raised in Guyana and St. Vincent. He studied Computer
Science in Trinidad &amp; Tobago, then moved to New Zealand for
his Ph.D., and then to the US for his professorship
positions.</p>

<p>He was warm and gentle, compassionate and kind, encouraging
and helpful. He was full of positive energy. He loved
sports, played a guitar, and enjoyed Jazz and Caribbean
reggae. He was a devoted family man, had two children—
Richard and Jeanelle—and a loving wife Sheriffa. In recent
years, she often accompanied him, both on his long
sabbatical as well as on shorter visits to conferences.</p>

<p>Robert did not slow down or stop working when he found out
about his cancer. He definitely wanted all of us to continue
making modeling a success. He once said that it was his
family and his work that kept him alive, let him think of
positive things, and distracted him from his illness. He
died on February 15th after a long struggle with his cancer
at home, in peace, with Sheriffa by his side. He and his
family decided that he should be buried in St. Vincent,
where he was raised and where his parents still live.</p>

<p>Our deepest condolences to Robert’s family: his wife
Sheriffa, son Richard, daughter Jeanelle, his grandmother
and parents, his sisters and brothers, and many nieces,
nephews, and cousins.</p>

<p>Rest in peace, dear Robert!</p>

<p>The SoSyM team. Marsha, Geri, Martin, Jean-Marc, Bernhard,
and Martin</p>
