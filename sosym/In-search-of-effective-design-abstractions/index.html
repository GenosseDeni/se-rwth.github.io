<p>The perceived popularity of the modeling languages such as
the UML may lead some to believe that there is wide-spread
appreciation of the value of modeling in the software
development industry. Informal polls in North American trade
journals seem to indicate otherwise. Use of the UML seems to
be limited to the use of use cases for requirements and
class diagrams for graphically representing programs. The
polls also seem to indicate that awareness of the Object
Management Group’s Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is not
widespread. As MDA is currently the most widespread
model-based development approach this strongly indicates
that much needs to be done to convince practicing developers
of the value of model-driven development approaches in
general. But, we expect to see in 2004 a surge in modeling
tools in particular those that claim to be “MDA-Compliant”.
Tool support is essential to realizing the vision of
model-driven development, but use of tools without a solid
understanding of the principles and methods they support can
lead to failed projects and faulty perceptions of
modeldriven development. In this editorial we reflect on the
value of the abstraction principle in software development
and on how modeling approaches can support this principle.</p>

<p>The increasing complexity of evolving large software systems
has generated a renewed interest in software modeling
techniques. Inherent software complexity can arise from a
number of sources, for example, the need to support diverse
and complex data and computational resources, and diverse
users with competing needs. Rapidly evolving software
infrastructure can also contribute to the complexity of
creating and evolving software systems. For example, IT
departments are faced with the task of evolving large
integrated systems to take advantage of new middleware,
communication or other platform technologies in order to
maintain or gain competitive advantage. The rapid rate of
change in these technologies is a source of considerable
concern: the complexity of the software makes changing the
software an error-prone and arduous task that takes
considerable time. Managing software complexity can be
characterized as a search for the “right” abstractions.
Developers are seeking good abstractions that can help
reduce the time and effort needed to create and evolve
dependable systems.</p>

<p>Past research on design abstractions has produced
structuring techniques that are based on functional
abstractions (e.g., Structured Design), data abstractions
that encapsulate behavior and state of a conceptual entity (
Object-Oriented development), and service-based abstractions
in which data and functional elements pertaining to a set of
provided services are encapsulated in units called
components (Component-Based development). There are numerous
publications that describe how these abstractions can be
used to manage complexity, and there is some quantitative
context-specific evidence of their effectiveness. Today, the
rate of change in software platform and system integration
technologies
(e.g., middleware technology) is spawning a new generation
of complex software. For example, the pervasive and open
nature of the internet present developers of internet-based
software with challenges that are significantly different
from those faced by developers of software built for a
machine on a restricted network. Designers of these new
systems have to deal with a myriad of complex interdependent
dependability concerns (e.g., security, availability, error
recovery, service integrity). Research on model-driven and
aspect-oriented development can provide the abstraction
mechanisms needed to manage the complexity of this new breed
of software. An underlying theme in the discussion is the
need for design techniques that allow developers to define
abstractions in many dimensions.</p>

<p>As one of the large and innovative industrial consortia the
Object Management Group (OMG) has responded to the growing
complexity of software with an industry-driven initiative
called Model Driven Architecture (MDA). MDA technologies are
intended to raise the level of abstraction at which
developers conceive and implement software. In MDA, software
models are the primary artifacts of software development.
The key characteristic of an MDA approach is the use of
abstractions to separate technology-specific concepts from
technologyindependent concepts. Technology-independent
models are composed with technology-specific models (e.g.,
models that describe middleware and other infrastructural
elements) to obtain a design model that can be transformed
to code. Ideally, changing an application to exploit new
technology would require composing the
technology-independent model with a new set of
technology-specific models, and the composition and
subsequent transformation to deployable code would be
accomplished in a cost-effective and timely manner. This is
an appealing view of software development, but accomplishing
the ideal requires significant advances in modeling theory.
Furthermore, a sound and elaborated modeling theory would
allow us to transform, compose and refine models in a much
more general way than current MDA proposes.</p>

<p>Effective abstraction mechanisms are critical to the success
of model-driven development. Some of the more widely used
modeling techniques allow developers to separate concerns to
manage software complexity. The choice of abstractions
influences the design structure and can make it easier or
more difficult to evolve a system. A decision to structure a
design with respect to a set of design concepts can make it
necessary to spread information pertaining to set of equally
important design concepts across design units. The problem
is that understanding and evolving the latter set of
concepts is difficult because they are scattered and tangled
across the design model. Recent work on Aspect-Oriented
Programming
(AOP) addresses this problem at the programming level. One
also needs to support multi-dimensional separation of
concerns at other stages of development. Work in this area
has given rise to a field of research labeled AspectOriented
Modeling (AOM). In an AOM approach, a primary model reflects
decisions used to determine the core architecture of a
design, and aspects are localized descriptions of design
concepts that cannot be encapsulated in the primary design
structure. Composing a primary model with aspects results in
a comprehensive design model. Examples of design concepts
that can be usefully described by aspects are design
elements that address pervasive security and fault tolerance
concerns. Aspects can also describe technology-specific
design concepts, and thus AOM can be used as a vehicle for
approximating the MDA vision. Treating aspects as patterns (
e.g., security and middleware design patterns) facilitates
reuse of aspects.</p>

<p>AOM can also provide support for balancing competing design
objectives. Security, fault tolerance and other
dependability and functional objectives often compete with
each other in the sense that meeting an objective negatively
impacts the degree that another can be satisfied. In such
situations, developers should consider alternative ways of
meeting objectives and make trade-offs in order to balance
competing objectives. Obtaining a design that “balances” the
concerns can be challenging using existing design
techniques. With an AOM approach, the competing design
concepts can be modeled as aspects to allow developers to
plug in and unplug alternatives.</p>

<p>In 2004 we expect to see growing interest in the integration
of aspect-oriented, pattern-based, and modeldriven
development techniques. The results should provide a good
foundation for methods and tools that effectively support
model-driven development of complex software systems.</p>

<h5 id="papers-in-this-issue"><strong><em>Papers in this issue</em></strong></h5>

<p>We are pleased that <em>Cris Cobryn</em> found the time in his very
busy schedule to publish an Expert Voice paper. The paper,
<strong>“UML 3.0 and the future of modeling”</strong>, relates the history of
the UML definition with the future standardization efforts,
and some open challenges for model-driven development.</p>

<p>In their regular paper <strong>“OCL 1.4/5 vs 2.0 Expressions: Formal
semantics and expressiveness”</strong> the authors <em>Maria Victoria
Cengarle and Alexander Knapp</em> present a type system, an
operational and a denotational semantics for the expression
sublanguage of the Object Constraint Language. Their results
demonstrate that the changes introduced in OCL 2.0 restrict
its expressivity to primitive recursion while OCL 1.4/5 was
computationally complete. This foundational result shows how
important it is to carefully design a modeling language to
avoid expressivity problems that strongly impact practical
applicability.</p>

<p>The authors <em>Carlos Rossi, Manuel Enciso, and Inmaculada P.
de Guzman</em> in their paper <strong>“Formalization of UML state
machines using temporal logic”</strong> use a variant of temporal
logic that allows the definition of time points, intervals,
and dates. They demonstrate how to map the most important
features of Statecharts into the temporal logic variant.</p>

<p>An innovative extension to visual notations is presented in
the regular paper <strong>“Nesting in Euler Diagrams: syntax,
semantics and construction”</strong> presented by <em>Jean Flower, John
Howse, and John Taylor</em>. Nesting of diagrams is supported in
two popular diagram types: Venn diagrams in set theory and
Statecharts. In this article the authors provide a general
foundation to nesting of diagrams and their interpretation
in the context of visual modeling.</p>

<p>In the final regular paper of this issue <strong>“The OsMoSys
approach to multi-formalism modeling of systems”</strong> the authors
<em>Valeria Vittorini, Mauro Iacono, Nicola Mazzocca, and
Giuliana Franceschinis</em> introduce an approach to building
models that rely on several formalisms. They relate those
models at a syntactic level using meta-modeling techniques
and thus gain interoperability between different notations.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy reading the articles in this issue.</p>
