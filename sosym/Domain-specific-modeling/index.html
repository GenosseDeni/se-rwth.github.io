      <p>(based on <a href="#FR05a">[FR05a]</a>)</p>

<p>Looking at other engineering disciplines, it is evident that
modeling is a vital and important part of the development of
complex artifacts. Good modeling techniques provide support
for the separation of concerns principle, rigorous analysis
of designs, and for structuring construction activities.
Models can play a similar role in the development of
software-based systems. Furthermore, the software
development activity has a characteristic not present in
physical engineering: deliverable products (software
systems) can be generated from models (an observation made
by Bran Selic, IBM/Rational at an MDA summer school). This
characteristic can and should be exploited in our quest to
make software development an engineering activity.</p>

<p>The current landscape of modeling languages is highly
diverse. Graphical languages, such as Petri Nets and
Statecharts have successfully been used for years.
Standardized languages such as the SDL have had a good base
of tool support but have seen their use in industry diminish
over time. Languages can be specific to an application
domain (e.g., SDL was developed to support modeling of
telecommunication systems), to a development phase (e.g.,
SCR method uses a language designed specifically for
modeling requirements of reactive systems), or they can be
general-purpose (e.g., the UML). Recently, much attention is
on the development of domain-specific languages (DSLs).
Proponents of DSLs claim that their use can help bridge the
gap between a domain expert’s view of a software system and
its implementation. The domains covered by DSLs can range
from highly individual application areas, such as “railroad
planning applications” to broader domains, such as the
“embedded system domain”.</p>

<p>The UML was at first an attempt to unify various
object-oriented modeling languages, and it seemed that its
target applications were primarily business systems. The UML
is now being used to model applications and concepts in a
variety of domains, including embedded systems and business
workflows. While this broadened the scope of the UML it has
made it difficult to develop semantics that can be used to
support its application in a number of domains. This has led
to the realization that a single, consistent semantics that
supports the use of the UML may not be possible, and to the
view of the UML as a family of languages. There are
currently a number of semantic variation points in the UML
to support this notion. Developing a semantic framework for
the UML that takes into consideration its numerous variation
points is proving to be an extremely difficult task – and
the important issues are not all technical!</p>

<p>It should not be surprising then that in specific domains,
the use of existing “domain specific languages” persists. A
DSL, let it be a programming or a modeling language, has
several advantages. Among them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Domain specific constructs are better suited for
communication with users in the domain. The users can
better understand the models if they are presented in
domain-specific terms. This leads to the claim that domain
specific models are better suited for requirements
engineering than the UML.</li>
  <li>DSLs have restricted semantic scope (i.e., the number of
semantic variations they have to deal with is small
compared with general-purpose languages), thus developing
a semantic framework is less challenging.</li>
  <li>Restricting semantic scope can lead to better support for
generating implementations from models. Given an
appropriate component-framework that implements individual
constructs of the DSL, the composition of these components
can lead to powerful implementations.</li>
  <li>DSL’s increase domain specific reuse of components, which
can lead to improved the quality of systems and
order-of-magnitude improvements in time-to-market and
developer productivity. Examples from the
telecommunication indicate that a speedup factor of ten is
possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>So far DSL’s have been developed in an ad-hoc manner, that
is tooling was implemented without much reuse of existing
technology. Reuse was limited in some cases to use of
graphical framework for developing editors and the use of
parser generators for textual languages. More recent work
has focused on making the development of DSLs more
systematic. Among the DSL development environments that are
being created are Meta-Editors and graphical editor
environments that allow developers to quickly create new
DSLs and associated editors. In the MDA/MOF context, general
data structures for the abstract syntax of models and
techniques for their transformation are under development.
Software companies such as Microsoft have identified this as
an important area of development, and Microsoft and have
released early versions of DSL development environments.</p>

<p>The advent of frameworks for developing DSLs will raise new
challenges, some of which are identified below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If building or improving a DSL is a vital part of a
project, the development process needs to incorporate
these new activities. = It is not yet clear if a new breed
of software development specialists (domain engineers?)
will be needed to effectively carry out these new
activities.</li>
  <li>Two questions that will have to be addressed can be stated
as follows: Is there a need for company or industry wide
standard DSLs? If yes, who will develop the standards?</li>
  <li>If the burden of defining a new DSL becomes considerably
lower, we will probably see a large number of DSLs created
and used. The situation will be similar to the one faced
with the use of XML-Dialects:
Many Dialects will appear and their interoperability or
translation between them will be a major problem. This
could give rise to a modeling Tower of Babel.</li>
  <li>To prevent the Tower of Babel, it might be necessary to
build DSLs on a common syntactical and semantic base that
reaches far beyond a common infrastructure for defining
abstract syntax. The UML might provide such a base, but
how can one derive a structural or behavioral DSL from a
sub-language of the UML?</li>
  <li>A language should have a semantics (in its original
meaning of “meaning”). Will a DSL development framework
support practical definition of DSL semantics of DSLs? How
can this be done?</li>
</ul>

<p>The editors look forward to an interesting discussion on the
above and other challenges related to the development of
DSLs.</p>

<h5 id="the-models-conference-series"><strong><em>The MoDELS conference series</em></strong></h5>

<p>As some readers might know, the Software and Systems
Modeling Journal was born out of a stated need for a premier
communication medium for topics related to modeling. In this
area of research and practice, The UML conferences have
played a significant role in pusing the state of the art in
modeling and in evaluating modeling experience. Readers of
the first set of SoSyM special issues will recall that they
consisted of the best papers in these conferences.</p>

<p>When the SoSyM journal started, it was already clear that
the UML will be an important but by not the only modeling
language. For this reason, SoSyM’s scope was defined to be
inclusive of all other software-based system modeling
languages.In the UML/modeling community this was also clear:</p>

<p>45% of the papers at the UML conferences were MDA-related
papers, and many of those were not related to UML. Keynotes
of the UML’2004 addressed topics on software composition (
Oscar Nierstrasz) and generative software development (by
Krzysztof Czarnecki).</p>

<p>In 2005 the widening of the conference scope to all modeling
related topics will occur. The UML-conference series will be
renamed the</p>

<p>MoDELS-conference series,
where MoDELS is an acronym for “Model Driven Engineering
Languages and Systems”. The successful UMLseries of
conferences will continue and keep its focus on models of
software and software-related systems. However, it will have
tracks for papers on UML, Model Driven Architecture (MDA)
and Domain Specific Languages
(DSL). For more details about the conference see the
following website: <a href="http://www.modelsconference.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.modelsconference.org</a>.</p>
