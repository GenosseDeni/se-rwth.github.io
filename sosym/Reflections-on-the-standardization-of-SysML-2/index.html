      <p>(based on <a href="#GR21a">[GR21a]</a>)</p>

<p>In 2018, we wrote an editorial entitled “Agile Model-Based
System Development” <a href="#GR18c">[GR18c]</a>, in which we made several
observations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>“In fact, modeling is at the heart of almost any
engineering discipline. Thus, it is not surprising that
our engineering colleagues have developed a detailed
portfolio of modeling techniques to describe their
systems in various perspectives, viewpoints, and
abstractions.”</li>
  <li>“However, the state-of-the-art in systems modeling has
several challenges, where each modeling aspect and view
is often assisted by an individual modeling and analysis
tool. Data exchange between the tools is complicated,
even though mostly automated, but suffers from concerns
about robustness, completeness of the mappings between
the models, as well as regular version upgrades of tools.
A second problem is that these mappings between models
are not easy to standardize, because different projects
use the same modeling languages in different forms (
semantics), which enforces configurable mappings or
individually developed translations per project.”</li>
  <li>“Traditional engineers use system models to design and
understand the product through analysis and automation of
engineering tasks. Therefore, models should be more than
just documentation artifacts. Each model that captures a
perspective of the project should either become a part of
the product construction or should be used for automated
validation and test quality management.”</li>
</ol>

<p>We also discussed that traditional systems development has
not yet reached the maturity of agile software development
for a number of reasons, including the far too long,
complex, and dependent tool chain.</p>

<p>Currently, the development of the updated standard SysML 2.0
is a larger effort, where the stakeholders are trying to
accommodate a number of these problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The language itself has received a renovation in its
syntactical shape, with the expectation that a
consolidated set of syntactic constructs leads to a
better methodical use of the various modeling
sub-languages.</li>
  <li>SysML 1 was defined as a profile based on the UML, which on
first consideration was a good idea, but in reality and
practice led to a number of complications. Therefore,
SysML 2 will be a standalone language independent from
UML. SysMLs relation to other modeling languages, like
UML, CAD, PLM, etc. is therefore not part of the SysML
standardization. (But because SysML and UML are at least
partially overlapping there is potential to create
inconsistencies and confusion).</li>
  <li>SysML 2 will cover an even wider range of views that can
be described, even embedding geometrical models, such as
CAD and physical simulation models of various forms.</li>
</ol>

<p>It will be interesting to see the results of the new SysML
standardization effort.</p>

<p>On the one hand, the community seems to pretty much agree
that a standardization that addresses many systems modeling
needs is necessary; to quote Wittgenstein, “The limits of my
language mean the limits of my world.” On the other hand, we
know from UML, that trying to cover every aspect and
viewpoint leads to a complex language, which in turn leads
to reluctance to learn and adopt the language. Possible
solutions to this challenge will not be to reduce the
complexity of the language, but to modularize the language
in such ways that it can be used and learned in pieces,
without having to deal with the rest of the language in
total. Both natural language, as well as typical electrical
and mechanical engineering norms, are often built that way.
Such modularization should not only include the syntax, but
also the internal tool representations and semantics.
Therefore, we suggest:</p>

<p>Make SysML modular in all relevant dimensions.</p>

<p>It would be very helpful if SysML is not presented as a big
blob, but rather as a set of “packages” or “layers” of
individually usable sub-languages. We suggest:</p>

<p>SysML should become a library
of independent, individually usable languages, and with a
clear understanding of how they relate.</p>

<p>Standards need to be produced collaboratively by
individuals. Frequently, these collaborators seek compromise
to arrive at the best possible effort and results, but they
are sometimes biased by their own personal background and by
their own company’s interests that are supporting their
participation in the standardization committee. In the case
of SysML (and formerly UML), stakeholders are often tool
vendors who have their own specific goals and objectives, and
want to protect their own intellectual property (e.g.,
algorithms, tools, and processes) against becoming outdated
because of different interpretations of the language in the
standard. This may be even more prevalent for large user
groups that have adopted specific tools and the embedded
version of the SysML language that is manifest in such tools
in certain forms. This is a typical phenomenon, where the
tool developers originally create clever ideas, which might
really be an optimal realization based on their target
domain and their own background. But once these algorithms
are implemented, they become a legacy asset and contribute
toward the complexity of a standardization effort. As a
result, compromises among the committee stakeholders often
leave the semantics of the language open to interpretation
in some subtle nuances, allowing several different
tool-realizations to be valid. This has advantages (e.g.,
domain-specific specializations are possible), but also
creates disadvantages (e.g., the less precise a language is
defined, the more difficult for users to understand it).
Therefore, we also suggest:</p>

<p>Make SysML a language with precise syntax and semantics.</p>

<p>And to overcome the tool vendor and other stakeholder bias:</p>

<p>Ask researchers to identify
optimal language syntax and semantics design.</p>

<p>This recommendation, however, raises another important
issue, which can be observed in typical standardization
processes. If a goal is to make a language precise, then a
“meta-language” is needed that supports the description of
both syntax and semantics. For the syntax, we have mainly
two approaches, namely grammars for the textual models and
metamodels (often expressed as class diagrams)
for visual models. The desire for a precise semantics is not
surprising, because the majority of stakeholders for a
standardization process must be able to understand the
standard. The semantics of a modeling language, however,
cannot be defined easily using a class diagram. Many research
papers, including some from the authors of this editorial,
have been investigating approaches that produce a precise
and understandable semantics. Please note that we use the
term semantics as “meaning of a model” as opposed to
“behavior of a program”, because each modeling language (
including class diagrams) has semantics, but some languages
are focused on structure instead of behavior. Because class
diagrams are too restricted in their expressivity, we
suggest:</p>

<p>Ask researchers to defne a formally precise semantics.</p>

<p>We also recommend that tool developers use the results and
findings of this formally precise semantics to verify their
context condition checkers, tool analyses and code syntheses
against this semantics. This will result in a significant
improvement on quality.</p>

<p>Because only certain aspects of the language semantics can
be described using a class diagram on the “meta-level”,
another possibility is to specify the semantics of a model
by describing the effects during its execution in the form of
interpretation. This is a kind of operational semantics
based on an abstract machine. This type of semantics
definition is suitable for generation of code for prototypes,
simulation and also for product code. But it also reduces a
modeling language to a mere programming language, because
developers then will no longer model properties in a compact
form, but will “program” their models to become efficiently
executable. A goal of SysML 2 is to cover all aspects of
development and, therefore, requires it also to be a real
modeling and specification language. This means that SysML 2
must be capable of allowing underspecification. If decisions
are to be postponed, requirements will describe a bandwidth
or range of possible realizations. Thus, variants of the
system shall be possible and need to be specified, and
uncertainty in development and during system operations must
be captured. Therefore, we suggest: While it is ok to
provide an executable semantics for a specific subset of the
SysML, please also</p>

<p>Develop a true specification
language that allows to capture underspecification in
various forms.</p>

<p>Last year in [GR20a], we also argued that analysis is very
important. In addition to traditional static analysis that
considers the known context conditions, as well as the
analysis of a simulated execution, there are additional
possibilities for performing advanced analysis of models. In
particular, symbolic analysis is of deep interest for
analyzing underspecified models because such analysis allows
the capture of all possible behaviors, through mimicking
all (or at least the major) execution paths in parallel.
Thus, we finally suggest:</p>

<p>Besides a standardization of
the language, it would be very beneficial to also
standardize the kinds of analyses desired for SysML.</p>

<p>Let us closely watch how the SysML standardization will
proceed. For scientists, the typical way to evaluate a
standardization effort is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(1) run experiments with the expected or then defined
standard</li>
  <li>(2) develop and argue for improved language variants</li>
  <li>(3) develop smart synthesis and analysis algorithms</li>
  <li>(4) design well-calibrated “model smell” techniques</li>
  <li>(5) publish all findings in an appropriate conference or
journal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both the MODELS conference and the SoSyM journal were
originally founded to accompany the UML 1 standardization
effort. They will of course also serve to help the SysML
standards become the best possible definition that will serve
the needs of multiple stakeholders.</p>
