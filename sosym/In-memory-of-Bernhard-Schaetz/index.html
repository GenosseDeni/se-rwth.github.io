<p>We were shocked about the passing of Dr. rer. nat. Dr.
habil. Bernhard Sch√§tz, also known as Barnie, on July 23rd, 2017. He finally lost the fight and passed away after a long
battle against cancer. He was only 52 years old.</p>

<p>Bernhard Sch√§tz was an extraordinary scientist and
researcher. Completely free from any pursuit of
self-promotion he devoted himself with great service to
science and research. He had the extraordinary gift for
excellent scientific work and yet the ability for an
implementation in practical projects. His strength was not
only his own scientific work, he could also inspire others
for his subjects and thus create and lead his own research
group. Especially noteworthy were his abilities to
collaborate with practitioners and to achieve valuable
results.</p>

<p>Bernhard Sch√§tz came to the research group Software and
Systems Engineering (SSE) of Manfred Broy only a few months
after Manfred‚Äôs start at the Technical University of Munich.
Bernhard Rumpe had known Barnie already from his studies,
but became a closer friend when collaborating intensively at
the SSE group. From the beginning, Bernhard Sch√§tz was at
the core of the SSE group, working on central topics. He
always was very careful and precise. He never gave a piece
of text that came from his pen out of hand, if not with
greatest care worded and scientifically sound. In 1998, he
successfully completed his doctorate a pioneering work
called ‚ÄúEin methodischer √úbergang von asynchron zu synchron
kommunizierenden Systemen‚Äù, tackling the combination of
asynchronous high-level specifications to restricted
synchronous implementations.</p>

<p>With his outstanding skills, both to the basic work, as well
as his applied work, he was the driving force behind tool
development in the SSE group. His work characterized many
tools, starting with AutoFocus in its three incarnations,
but had also impact on many other tooling infrastructures,
such as MontiCore and MontiArc.</p>

<p>He was also instrumental in founding Validas AG. He was a
member of the board of Validas AG from the beginning until
the end of his life, serving as a widely respected member of
the Supervisory Board, and with his wise advise strongly
championed the development of the company support.</p>

<p>Since he was completely dedicated to scientific work, he
worked after finishing his doctorate towards a habilitation,
which he successfully completed with a remarkable defence a
few days before Christmas in 2009.</p>

<p>In the construction of the An-Institute fortiss of the
Technical University of Munich, Bernhard Sch√§tz was very
enthusiastic from the beginning. He served as Scientific
Director at fortiss with the research group on model-based
development, where he was Vice-Managing Director. His
efforts led to the structure and growth of the research
institute within 5 years to a size of over 100 employees.</p>

<p>Bernhard Sch√§tz also internationally received the highest
respect. He was co-organizer of several events of the
community, ranging from Dagstuhl events, over MBEES up to
MODELS, where he chaired the industrial track in 2013. He
was a long-standing member of the SoSyM Editorial Board from
2008 until his far too early death.</p>

<p>He was both valued for his great expertise, but also his
deep insights into practical work and the numerous,
successful projects he has has performed. His reliability
was proverbial. You could always depend on his words. For
example, he was consistently the reviewer who turned in his
very accurate reviews first.</p>

<p>During the construction of the Center Digitization.Bayern,
Bernhard Sch√§tz was also vitally active in the task force to
build the center. Again, capitalized from his comprehensive
skills, but also with his vision and his deep understanding
to make essential contributions.</p>

<p>Our horror was great, when we learned that Barnie suffered
from a terrible, incurable cancer. But for a number of years
he did not allow himself to be beaten by this disease. He
struck out any offer to step down in his job or as SoSyM
editor and get stronger in fighting his illness. Bernhard
Sch√§tz fulfilled his scientific tasks with the same
discipline and the same enthusiasm as before. But, he
finally could not escape. Bernhard Sch√§tz was a highly
esteemed colleague, a friend, a valuable adviser, an
internationally recognized scientist, but also an
outstanding person, who dealt with employees and colleagues
proving only the highest human qualities. He has done
extraordinary. We will never overcome his loss.</p>

<p>We are in deep sadness to his family, his friends, his
relatives and his colleagues.</p>

<p>Bernhard Sch√§tz wrote 193 recorded research items
(according to Researchgate) which have by the end of 2017
been cited more than 2500 times (according to Google
Scholar). DBLP lists among others:</p>

<ul>
  <li>24 journal articles (5 of them in SoSyM)</li>
  <li>84 conference and workshop papers, and</li>
  <li>20 editorships</li>
</ul>

<p>He curated an impressive list of 59 co-authors, showing his
degree of esteem and respect among the community. One
colleague once said that it was always fun arguing with him
on scientific topics and issues, but you never could get him
into a personal argument. We will miss the always fruitful
discussions on topics of software engineering, modeling and
specification using formal methods in highly practical
projects.</p>
